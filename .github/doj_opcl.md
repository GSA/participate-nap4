# Access to Information; Increase Transparency of Privacy Programs and Policies on Agency Websites and Digital Services. 
 
## Topline Description 
Federal information must be protected and agencies must be transparent about their policies and practices with respect to personally identifiable information (PII).

## Key Objective(s) 
Ensure the protection of privacy in Federal information while also promoting transparency of policies and practices related to PII. 

## Paragraph Description 
The Federal Government creates, collects, uses, processes, stores, maintains, disseminates, discloses, and disposes of PII to carry out missions mandated by Federal statute. Consistent with applicable law, regulations, and government-wide policies, Federal Agencies must ensure the reliability and usability of information on the agenciesâ€™ public websites and digital services, as well as provide quality information that is readily accessible to all.  This requires agencies to provide clear and accessible notice regarding the creation, collection, use, processing, storage, maintenance, dissemination, disclosure, and disposal of PII.
