# Improving FOIA from the Inside Out
 
## Topline Description 
To further modernize FOIA and assist in meeting demand, the Department of Justice will launch a comprehensive FOIA Self-Assessment Toolkit that will provide agencies a much needed resource to examine their entire FOIA process in order to implement best practices and improved strategies for success.  

## Key Objective(s) 
At the core of government transparency is the Freedom of Information Act.  The FOIA is a vital tool for the public to learn more about government and year after year the demand for FOIA continues to increase.  Now more than ever it is important that agencies examine each aspect of their FOIA programs to ensure that they have the most effective systems in place to provide good customer services, respond to requests promptly, and to make more information available online. By utilizing the Toolkit agencies can ensure that we are providing the best FOIA service for the American public.  

## Paragraph Description 
The open source CFPB eRegulations platform has been expanded and is being used by additional government agencies including live instances with the FEC, ATF, a notice and comment pilot project collecting live public comment with the EPA, and now beginning an engagement with OMB using the platform to organize, track and sort policy documents.
