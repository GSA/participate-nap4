# Open HUD Data to Benefit Local Communities
 
## Topline Description 
HUD will expand the data in the Community Assessment Reporting Tool (CART), an application that shows how HUD has invested in a community, with additional programmatic data, enhanced reporting capabilities, and additional geographies.

## Key Objective(s) 
This objective creates more transparency, participation, and collaboration by releasing additional HUD data, via the CART, to fill information gaps at the local level.

## Paragraph Description 
State and local governments are increasingly using Federal open data to deliver value and improve citizen services at the local level. In December 2016, HUD launched the Community Assessment Reporting Tool (CART).  This application contains datasets from HUD programs to help citizens discover the Department’s work taking place in their own communities. As part of the eGIS Program, HUD will maintain CART’s data to ensure it remains current in order to effectively assist HUD’s many stakeholders, including citizens, researchers, and journalists to visualize many of HUD’s investments in a single, 508 compliant, application.  Pending available resources, HUD will perform additional development on CART to add functionality to fill crucial information gaps at the local level and spur civic innovations that foster economic growth, community resilience, and other opportunities to encourage the healthy development of communities.
