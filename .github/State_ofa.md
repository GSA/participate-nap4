# Increasing the usability and uptake of open foreign assistance data
 
## Topline Description 
Increase the use and uptake of open foreign assistance data

## Key Objective(s) 
Increased foreign assistance transparency has the power to promote effective development by helping recipient governments manage their aid flows and by empowering citizens to hold governments accountable for how foreign assistance is spent in their country. Over the past few years, more foreign assistance data has been available than ever before with over 500 publishers to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) standard, however, awareness and use of the data is still relatively low. 

In order to support data driven decision-making in development, potential users need to be made aware of this data. When provided with open foreign assistance data a variety of stakeholders express interest and potential uses, but to truly increase uptake the US needs to understand if the current formats and functions are what is needed to be truly useful.

Through this commitment the US will invite greater participation and openness with overseas government counterparts as well as with overseas civil society groups. This commitment will invite increased participation, as in order to make the data more useful, the US will need to understand the current limitations and implement change where possible. This leads to collaboration for achieving a common goal which is data-driven decision-making.
